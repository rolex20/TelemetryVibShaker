This program, listens on the Ethernet network for UDP Packets with two bytes.

The first byte is the intensity for the first motor.
The second byte is the intensity for the second motor.
The motors can be small cellphone vibrator motors sticked to your throttle or joystick.
I use the first motor to generate vibration effects when the speedbrakes are extended and the second motor to generate vibration effects when the flaps are extended.

ToDo1:  Add diagram and pictures
Todo2:  Integrate the two ArduinoR4WiFi programs into 1 that listens in Ethernet if it is connected otherwise, WiFi
Todo3:  Maybe use the Led Matrix to show some status (right now is covered by the Ethernet Shield)
Todo4:  Clean the code some more
Todo5:  Add more motors?  I don't need more effects, do you? The reason I only programmed two motors is because I only have two controls where I can feel them (throttle and joystick).  For bass shakers there are other software already available and more complete.
