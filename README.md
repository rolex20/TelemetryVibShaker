How this can help you be a better sim pilot?  A real F-16 pilot knows when the angle of attack is in optimal range because they receive many physical cues such as G's, buffet sounds, the feel of speed and possibly many others.  As a flight-sim pilot, I don't have a way to feel those cues, so I created this set of tools initially to play a sound whenever the F-16 was in the optimal angle of attack, between 11 and 15.  Then I started adding support for other fighter units and other events such as the flaps for example: When I use the F-14 sometimes I use the flaps trick to beat my opponent but then the risk is to forget to raise the flaps before passing 220 knots.  So, this program will make some motors vibrate and the motor is sticked to my joystick, so I feel some vibration which helps me remember to raise the flaps and increase the immersive experience.
