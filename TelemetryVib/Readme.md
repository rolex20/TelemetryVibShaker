This program, listens on the WiFi network for UDP Packets with two bytes.  

The first byte is the intensity for the first motor.  
The second byte is the intensity for the second motor.  
The motors can be small cellphone vibrator motors sticked to your throttle or joystick.   
I use the first motor to generate vibration effects when the speedbrakes are extended and the second motor to generate vibration effects when the flaps are extended.


ToDo: Add diagram and pictures
